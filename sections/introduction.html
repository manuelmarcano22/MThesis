<p>Important in real estate, but also seemingly an important factor to take into account when studying compact objects in binary systems. It seems that, like with people, where you were born plays a role in your evolution. This seems to be true for cataclysmic variables (CVs), the kind of compact binary system that we will explore in more detail in the present work. Our goal is to try to understand the formation of these kinds of systems when they are formed in a crowded and high density environment (like in a cluster of stars), and when you give them enough time to evolve and interact with other stars (like in a globular cluster).</p>
<p>Now that we have defined our broad goal letâ€™s take a step back and explore in more detail what are compact objects, their different types, and the different ways they can interact with each other and other types of stars (Sec. [sec:co]). That section will lead us to the discussion of where and how we expect to find them, and what can we learn by studying them in the different environment where they form (sections [sec:gc]).</p>
